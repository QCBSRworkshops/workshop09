To prepare for this workshop, you must do the following steps:

Download the R script and data required for this workshop:

-    [R Script](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/multivar1_e.r)
-    [DoubsEnv data](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/DoubsEnv.csv)
-    [DoubsSpe data](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/DoubsSpe.csv)
-    [Coldiss R function](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/coldiss.R)

Make sure to load the following packages (see how in the R script):

-    [vegan (for multivariate
    analyses)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html)
-    [gclus (for clustering
    graphics)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gclus/index.html)
-    [ape (for
    phylogenetics)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ape/index.html)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("vegan")
install.packages("gclus")
install.packages("ape")

library(vegan)
library(gclus)
library(ape)

source(file.choose()) # use coldiss.R which you have downloaded to your own directory
```
