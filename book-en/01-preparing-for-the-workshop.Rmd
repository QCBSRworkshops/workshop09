# (PART\*) Multivariate Analyses in `R` {-}

# Learning objectives


1. Learn the basics of multivariate analysis to reveal patterns in community composition data

2. Use `R` to perform an unconstrained ordination

3. Learn about similarity and dissimilarity coefficients and transformations to perform multivariate analysis

4. Use `R` to create dendrograms

5. Learn the following methods:

  * Clustering analysis
  * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  * Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA)
  * Non-Metric MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS)

To prepare for this workshop, you must do the following steps:

Download the data required for this workshop:

- [DoubsEnv data](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/DoubsEnv.csv)
- [DoubsSpe data](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/DoubsSpe.csv)

Their data can also be retrieved from the `ade4` package:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library (ade4)
data (doubs)

spe <- doubs$fish
env <- doubs$env
```

Alternatively, from the `codep` package:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library (codep)
data (Doubs)

spe <- Doubs.fish
env <- Doubs.env
```

Download the RScript containing the `coldiss()` function:

- [R Script](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/multivar1_e.r)
- [Coldiss R function](http://qcbs.ca/wiki/_media/coldiss.R)

You must also use these packages:
* [ape](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ape)
* [ade4](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ade4)
* [codep](https://cran.r-project.org/package=codep)
* [gclus](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gclus)
* [vegan](https://cran.r-project.org/package=vegan)
* [GGally](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GGally)
* [PlaneGeometry](https://cran.r-project.org/package=PlaneGeometry)
* [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes)

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
list.of.packages <- c("ape", "ade4", "codep", "gclus", "vegan", "GGally", "PlaneGeometry", "remotes", "matlib")

new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]

if(length(new.packages) > 0) {
  install.packages(new.packages, dependencies = TRUE) 
  print(paste0("The following package was installed:", new.packages)) 
} else if(length(new.packages) == 0) {
  print("All packages were already installed previously")
}

# Load all required libraries at once
lapply(list.of.packages, require, character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE)

# source(file.choose()) # use coldiss.R which you have downloaded to your own directory
```
